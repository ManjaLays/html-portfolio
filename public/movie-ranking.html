<h2>Top 3 Malayalam December Releases of 2024</h2>
<hr />

<h3>☞ Barroz</h3>
<p>The Mohanlal starer movie was an absolute disaster in the big screens, dissatisfying both adult and childen audiances.</p>
<p>⭐️4.1/10</p>

<h3>☞ ED - Extra Decent</h3>
<p>A rare dark humour gem. But failed to bring crowd to the big screens.</p>
<p>⭐️5.8/10</p>

<h3>☞ Marco</h3>
<p>Apart from being a breakthrough in Unni Mukundan's career, the movie was just an average flick. The voilances showcased was the best in the industry. </p>
<p>⭐️4.1/10</p>

<h3>☞ Rifle Club</h3>
<p>The December winner according to me. Being a small movie, the shots, screenplay, esthetics.. all where very pleasing.</p>
<p>⭐️7.8/10</p>
